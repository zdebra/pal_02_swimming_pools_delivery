### Weak street 

The street from A to B which, if entered, there is no way back to A.

### Weak crossing

A crossing is weak if at least one weak street begins there. 

### Strong crossing

All streets begins here are not weak.

### A connection from crossing A to crossing B

A sequence of streets a truck passes from A to B.

### A strong connection

- passes only through strong crossings
- passes through minimum possible number of streets

### A target for a crossing X

Another crossing Y is a target for X if there is mutal strong connection between X and Y.

### Variability of strong crossing X

The number of targets of X

### The cost

Let crossing Y be a target for X. The cost of Y is a number which is equal to twice the length of the strong connection from X to Y plus the length of the strong connection from Y to X.

### The cost of a strong crossing X

Is equal to the sum of the costs of all targets for X. 

### A prospective crossing

Is a strong crossing which variability is maximum and its cost is minimum among all strong crossings with maximum variability.
